My name is Zoran, and I really love tech and coding. I love that feeling when you finally finish a code! 

I work with Dart and Flutter, although I know CSS and HTML too. 

I love contributing to FOSS community, so if you need help with your FOSS app, just tell me!

Currently working on f.Sentence, app with text editing, note taking, PDF annotation and whole lot more! That is my main project right now.

I love Frutiger Aero era in design, as well as skeumorphism. It really gives special taste to software!
